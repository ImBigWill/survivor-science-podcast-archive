# Survivor Science Podcast Archive

This is a static archive of the **Survivor Science Podcast**, hosted by Will Schmierer.

## About the Show

Survivor Science ran for 78 episodes from January 2023 through January 2025. Originally launched as *The Lovable Survivor Podcast*, the show was rebranded to Survivor Science in late 2024.

The podcast covered stroke and brain injury recovery — real science, real stories, and real strategies from survivors and experts who've done the work. Will Schmierer, a stroke survivor living with MS, shared what he learned through thousands of hours of studying, testing, and living recovery.

Topics included mindset, breathwork, community building, returning to work after stroke, managing fatigue, navigating relationships, and much more.
